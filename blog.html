            <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.</p>

            <p><strong>React HOOKS</strong></p>
            <p>Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.Hooks are backward-compatible, which means it does not contain any breaking changes. Also, it does not replace your knowledge of React concepts.</p>
